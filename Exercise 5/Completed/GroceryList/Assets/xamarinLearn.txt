Note: an android app is a collection of cooperative activites 
Activites : consest of two files axml which is the UI and a C# file which is the behiver.

Note:an activity can start another activity in or from the same apk(same application).

OS Services: system services such as (Network connection,Displaying notifications,GPS.....ect)

context class: have all the files or access to all the files and system services required for your app(folders,OS,database....).
Note:activity class inherits from context therefor the activity class have all the files and access to all files.
Note:context provides a collection of services to your Activity.

Intent class: is a request you send to android OS to start an activity , you also can send attributes inside the intent.
Note:an explicit Intent is An Intent that exactly identifies the target Activity that you want to start.
Note:an explicit Intent can start an activity in your apk or another app apk as long as you know the packge name and the class name.

Note:There are multiple ways to start an Activity.Some give you the ability to pass arguments, some let you harvest results,
and some are convenience methods for simple cases.

Note:There are three main navigation pattrens (stack,tap,drawer) 

Back Stack: is a historical recored of the user's live activity. Android automatically adds and removes activity to the back stack
when the user start a new activity or pushs the back button to exit an activity.


Bundle class : A data structure of key value pares passed between activates like dict and json in python.
Note: you pass arguments between activates by loading them into a bundle , (objects must be serializaied to be passed  )

Note: there's two ways to load intent extrases (data)
1) expicit creation by creating a bundle object and an intent , fuiling the bundle with data and using putExtras method to load the bundle into the intent
2) create an intent , the intent class already has method to create a bundle and load it with data.
Note: to retrieve back the data passed in the intent use the inherited property named (Intent) and the method (GetIntExtra).

Activity and Target Activity : are two activties interacting with each other by passign data to one onther or starting the target activity ....
Note:source activity can send and recive data back from the traget activity in the form of (no return value,only a seucess/faluer code, data and a seucess/faluer code).
the source activity send an intent Extras request code to the target activity , the target activity will return the same request code as well as a result code
and an intent containing a bundle of Extras.


Note: when the source activity needs to get back result from the target activity , the source activity needs to call the (StartActivtiyForResult) method instead
of (StartActivty) and overrides (OnActivityResult) method to recive the result when the target is fnished. In the target activity we need to call (setResult)
to return a secusse or faluir code as well as an optional intent full of extras

Result code:is an intger you pass to an activity to help identify it . you will get the same value back when the activity finshes.
Note: it dosen't matter what the value is because it's only meaningfull for you to identify the activty .
Note: your target activty uses it's (setResult(resultcode, intent)) to report it's result back to the source.
Note: you override  "onActivityReslut()" in your source activity to receive these result.

Note: The MainActivity used StartActivityForResult to launch the AddItemActivity. This means that when AddItemActivity finishes, the OnActivityResult method in MainActivity will run.
This is where you retrieve the results.

########################################################
android apps are often discriped as a collection of collaboration activities that include all the activities installed on a divice regurdless of which app 
the came from.

Implicit intent: is an intent that dosen't identify the exacte activity to start instead , it discreibe the action that needs get done and let android
choose and activity to handle your requeist and if there's more then one activity to do that , android will display a picker to let you decide.

Note: implicit intent are tipically used to start an activity outside of your apk.However can also be used to start an activity inside your apk but that's
not common since expicit intent are easier to work with.

implicit intent can contain:
Action: At a highe level is the thing you want to get done.
Data: data that get passed to the target activity like a phone number or an email address.
MIME Type: kind of inforamtion that the activity is going to operate on helping android to decide which activty to launch.
Categories: can be a highe level of discription of style of activity you want.
Extras: to get more details about what you want to get done to the target activity or give it data to operate on.
